# jenkins-builder

`jenkins-builder` is a gem for submit jenkins building tasks from command line.

## Requirements

  1. The gem use macOS KeyChain for managing credentials for logging into jenkins website, so macOS is the only supported OS by now.
  2. It use the `fzf` fuzzy selecting utility to filter jenkins job names and git branches, so before using this gem, you should install `fzf` first: `brew install fzf`.

## Installation

    $ gem install jenkins-builder

## Usage

### Getting help information

    $ jk help
    
### Setup

All configuration is stored in `$HOME/.jenkins-builder.yaml` except password.

Password is stored in macOS KeyChain, its service name is `jenkins-builder-credentials`.

#### Setup URL and credentials interactively

Just run: `$ jk setup`

#### Show settings information

    $ jk info
    
By default, it does now show password, but if you want it: `$ jk info -p`

#### Edit config file directly

    # jk setup -e
    
### Build

#### Specify job identifiers as command line arguments

    $ jk build project1 project2 ...

#### Specify git brand if you use mbranch plugin

    $ jk build project:origin/develop project2:origin/master ...
    
#### Suppress console output of build

    $ jk build -s project1 ...
    
#### Use fzf to filter job names (project names) or git branch names

Just run `jk build` without job identifiers specified as command line arguments:

    $ jk build

Even just (because `build` is the default task):

    $ jk

### Alias

For most working jobs, you can create aliases for them for convenice.

#### Create an alias

    $ jk alias p1 project1:origin/develop

then you could just run:

    $ jk p1
    
it's equivalent to run `jk build project1:origin/develop`

#### List aliases

    $ jk alias
    
#### Delete an alias

    $ jk unalias p1
